\section{Introduction}
The scope of the project is to create a fully interactive mall guide of sorts which will allow users to easily find shops as well as act as a shopping companion, providing a list of available specials within a store based on location as well as allowing users to add items to a shopping cart to purchase and have delivered later. This system also aims to replace electronic maps using augmented reality to guide users to a selected store.

\section{User characteristics}
\subsection{Customer}
This User will interact with the system in order to find a specific shop in a specific mall. The user will be navigated to the specific shop by use of AR. Depending on where the user is in the mall, items on special will be pushed onto the interface for them to see.
\subsection{Maintenance}
This User will update and maintain the system. If there are any shops being moved/renovated or the mall is being extended, this user will make sure that the system is up to date.
\subsection{Delivery Personnel}
This user will interact with the system in order to get the customer order from the shop and deliver it to the given location. This user will use the Google map feature integrated in our system to find the shortest route to the customers location.

\section{Constraints}

\subsection{Battery Life}
\paragraph{Beacon batteries don't last forever so when they die, they will gather no data. Which means that valuable data will be lost.}

\subsection{Costs}
\paragraph{Estimote beacons can be quiet expensive so if we have to cover the entire mall, it will be very expensive.}

\subsection{Range of Beacons} 
\paragraph{The beacons that will be used for this system only have a range of up to a 100 meters. This will be a major problem when when we are dealing with large floors that also have many levels.}

\subsection{GPS Inaccuracy}
\paragraph{Some mobile phones come with app notification features powered by both Geofences and GPS. The challenge here is that GPS can be inaccurate}


\section{Technology Decision}
\subsection{Database & Server Management - Firebase}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We chose Firebase because it provides realtime synchronized data. this means a user can store data with NoSQL cloud Database. when a user goes offline on the app, data remains available across all customers in real time.
    \item Google also provides free Analytic's for mobile apps when using firebase so that the user can see which data is accessed or searched the most so that the developer can modify the app for better user experience.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development - Native Android}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We chose Native Android because of it's superior beacon support.
    \item Native Android also ensure speed and agility for mobile Apps with responsiveness and great native app based UI
    \item Native Android applications are more interactive And intuitive. Native mobile apps run much smoother regarding user input and output. These types of apps inherit their devicesâ€™ OS interfaces, making them look and feel like an integrated part of the device.
    \item Native Android applications tend to have fewer bugs during development.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing - Travis-CI}
We chose to use Travis Ci for integration because of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It monitors GithHub projects very well.
    \item It easily allows deployment to cloud service
    \item It Runs tests and generates results quickly.
    \item It Easily identifies small and large changes.
\end{itemize}

         \item The system should give accurate and precise direction to the user at all times.
        \item The system should retrieve accurate prices and products every time the user scans or is near a specific product.

        \item The application should be able to accommodate a large number of users as they'll be navigating all around different malls.
        \item The application should be able to accommodate large volume of scanning and retrieving items from database for quotes.
    \end{itemize}
    
\section{Architecture and Design}

\subsection{System Type}
\noindent Our system is an event-driven system which relies on various changing states to accomplish use cases. These states are triggered based on certain system properties like device location.

\subsection{System Architecture}
\noindent\textbf{Client-Server:}\\
The system uses a centralised server to ensure all devices remain updated with identical information during usage and allows client applications to remain lightweight.\\\\
\noindent\textbf{Microservices:}\\
Each element of the client system is designed as a modular component that can be added, replaced or removed without affecting the system as a whole. These microservices work hand in hand to satisfy use cases.\\\\
\noindent\textbf{Model-View-Controller:}\\
Each microservice present on the client system makes use of a model in the form of the centralised database, a view to display processed information to the user and a controller to determine the flow of data through the system.\\\\
\noindent\textbf{Object Persistence Framework:}\\
The system as a whole relies on a database to ensure data is not lost between sessions. Certain use cases require that data persists outside of the client's individual usage sessions on the application.
